🚨 Phishing Alert System using Machine Learning

📌 Overview
The Phishing Alert System is a machine learning-powered web application that detects phishing URLs in real-time. It uses classification algorithms to predict whether a given website URL is legitimate or malicious. This system is useful for personal safety, browser integrations, corporate cyber defense, and educational purposes.

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
The system is trained and evaluated using multiple algorithms:

XGBoost (Best performing)

Random Forest

Decision Tree

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Logistic Regression

Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

📊 Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Features: 30+ features extracted from URLs (such as having_IP_Address, URL_Length, SSLfinal_State, etc.)

Target: Binary classification — 1 for phishing, -1 for legitimate
